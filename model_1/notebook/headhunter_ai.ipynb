    "\n",
    "- Extract and validate candidate’s information, working experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summary candidate highlights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask screening questions such as expected salary, reasons for leaving, motivation for opportunities\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/models/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface.\n",
    "* `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context.\n",
    "* `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types\n",
    "* `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory \n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`:\n",
    "* This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer`\n",
    "* When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conversation \n",
    "\n",
    "We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. "
