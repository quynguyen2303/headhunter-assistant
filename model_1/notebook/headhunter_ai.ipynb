    "## Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are one of the central LLM use-cases. The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/models/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface.\n",
    "* `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context.\n",
    "* `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types\n",
    "* `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let's install some dependencies and set the required credentials:"

Simple prompting: The agent can use prompt-based language models (LLM) to decompose tasks by providing simple prompts like \"Steps for XYZ\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\". This allows the agent to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can also use task-specific instructions to guide the decomposition process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to \"Write a story outline\" as a subgoal. These instructions provide specific guidance on how to decompose the task effectively.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: In some cases, agents can also rely on human inputs for task decomposition. This can involve collaborating with humans to break down the task into smaller subgoals or receiving instructions and guidance from humans throughout the process.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to effectively handle complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subgoals.'}"

Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4.
