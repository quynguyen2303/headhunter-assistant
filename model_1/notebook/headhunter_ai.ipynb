    "## Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are one of the central LLM use-cases. The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/models/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface.\n",
    "* `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context.\n",
    "* `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types\n",
    "* `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let's install some dependencies and set the required credentials:"

    "* When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored\n",
